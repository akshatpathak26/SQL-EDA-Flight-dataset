This repo contains SQL queries to analyze flight data from a database. The queries demonstrate how to:

- Find monthly flight volume
- Identify most expensive flight days 
- Get monthly flights per airline
- Filter flights by time and cities 
- Count weekend flights from a city
- Calculate arrival times
- Break down flights by quarter and airline
- Compare flight duration by stops
- Filter flights by airline and date range
- Find longest flights per airline
- Identify city pairs with long flights
- Build grid showing daily Bangalore/Delhi flights by time period
- Build grid showing average ticket price by time period

## Getting Started
To use these queries, import the included SQL file into a database containing flight data, such as the campusx.flights table referenced in the queries. Adjust table and column names as needed to match your schema.

These queries are intended for SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server. They use functionality like:

- Date manipulation
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX etc)
- JOIN and WITH clauses
- Conditional logic in CASE statements
